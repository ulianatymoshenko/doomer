        <h2>A feeling that a situation is very bad and without hope</h2>
        <p>
          "Doomer" and "doomerism" are terms which arose primarily on the
          internet to describe people who are extremely pessimistic or fatalist
          about global problems such as overpopulation, peak oil, climate
          change, and pollution. Some doomers assert there is a possibility
          these problems will bring about human extinction.

          By 2018, 4chan users had begun creating Wojak caricatures with the
          -oomer suffix to mock various groups online. One of these caricatures
          was "Doomers", 20-somethings who had "simply stopped trying" .The meme
          first appeared on 4chan's /r9k/ board in September 2018.The image
          typically depicts the Wojak character in a beanie, smoking a
          cigarette. The archetype often embodies nihilism and despair, with a
          belief in the incipient end of the world to causes ranging from
          climate apocalypse to peak oil to (more locally) opioid
          addiction.Kaitlyn Tiffany writes in The Atlantic that the doomer meme
          depicts young men who "are no longer pursuing friendships or
          relationships, and get no joy from anything because they know that the
          world is coming to an end."A related meme format, "doomer girl", began
          appearing on 4chan in January 2020, and it soon moved to other online
          communities, including Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr, often by women
          claiming it from its 4chan origins.This format is described by The
          Atlantic as "a quickly sketched cartoon woman with black hair, black
          clothes, and sad eyes ringed with red makeup". The doomer girl
          character often appears in image macros interacting with the original
          doomer character.The format is often compared to rage comics.
